## 3. AI in Fashion Retail – Business Strategy & Ethical Analysis

Strategic evaluation of H&M’s “Body Scan Jeans” AI technology and proposed implementation framework for Hallenstein Glassons (NZ).

This project focused on AI strategy, implementation planning, governance, and ethical risk analysis rather than model development.

**Key Areas Covered:**
- AI implementation lifecycle (POC → Pilot → Roll-out)
- Machine learning use in 3D body scanning
- Cost–benefit and sustainability impact analysis
- Risk assessment (bias, privacy, transparency)
- Māori data sovereignty and cultural considerations

**Key Outcome:**  
Developed a structured AI business case incorporating technical feasibility, governance frameworks, and responsible AI adoption strategy.
