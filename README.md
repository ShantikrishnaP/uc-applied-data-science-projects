## 3. Scalable Music Genre Classification & Recommendation (Million Song Dataset)

Implemented large-scale genre classification and collaborative filtering using Apache Spark on the Million Song Dataset.

**Scale & Engineering**
- ~97GB audio features dataset (HDFS)
- 48M+ user-song interactions
- 1M+ users and 384K+ songs
- Distributed processing using Spark

**Technologies**
- PySpark
- Spark ML
- HDFS
- Distributed data processing

**Key Contributions**
- Built binary and multiclass genre classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees)
- Addressed class imbalance (minority genre ~9.67%)
- Developed collaborative filtering recommendation model
- Applied repartitioning and caching strategies for performance optimization
- Evaluated using Precision@10, NDCG@10, and MAP metrics

**Outcome**  
Demonstrated scalable machine learning training and recommendation modeling in distributed environments.

## 4. AI in Fashion Retail – Business Strategy & Ethical Analysis

Strategic evaluation of H&M’s “Body Scan Jeans” AI technology and proposed implementation framework for Hallenstein Glassons (NZ).

This project focused on AI strategy, implementation planning, governance, and ethical risk analysis rather than model development.

**Key Areas Covered:**
- AI implementation lifecycle (POC → Pilot → Roll-out)
- Machine learning use in 3D body scanning
- Cost–benefit and sustainability impact analysis
- Risk assessment (bias, privacy, transparency)
- Māori data sovereignty and cultural considerations

**Key Outcome:**  
Developed a structured AI business case incorporating technical feasibility, governance frameworks, and responsible AI adoption strategy.
